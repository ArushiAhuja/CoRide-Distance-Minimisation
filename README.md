# CoRide-Distance-Minimisation
A Python program created using Pandas, NumPy and intertools to calculate the optimal combinations between pickup and drop locations to minimise pooling distance.

Output:
Average pooling savings (random pairing): 0.69 km
Average pooling savings (cosine+proximity filtered): 1.66 km
Our approach improves pooling efficiency by 141.8% over random pairing
